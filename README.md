<h1>Fix this app!</h1>

Thelonious Monk wants to build a site where we can keep track of legendary Jazz artists.
Naturally, he decided to create a Django project where the user can CRUD Artists and Albums.
His free-form coding style has sadly left us with a bunch of errors to fix.

<h2>Testing Goals</h2>

Consider the app fixed when you can do the following tasks:

1) View the home page
2) Get to the form to add an Artist, and create a new Artist in the database.
3) View all the artists on the home page
4) View and Edit an individual artist, successfully updating an artist to change their name
5) Add an Album to an artists individual discography by using the form on their profile ("show") page
